This is the reformulated version based on Billy's work, placed in the `original` folder. The `OSM_2_Formatted.mlx` generates dependent formatted data for `main.mlx`. And `main.mlx` provides visualizations.

Both of the `.mlx` live scripts can be more compact. You can try it if you like!

**Note:** You can test the codes with datasets. However, the dataset is rather extensive, so I put the dataset paths into `.gitignore`. If you have datasets folders like `FormattedDatasets` and `OSM_datasets`, please put them in the `datasets` folder. Make sure the `datasets` locates at the same level as the `original` folder.
